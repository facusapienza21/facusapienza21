## Hello, I'm Facundo (Facu) Sapienza 👋!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Standord Icy Physics Group](https://icyphysics.stanford.edu/people) wotrking with Ching-Yao Lai. Previosly I completed my PhD in the Department of Statistics at the University of California Berkeley working under the supervision of Fernando Pérez and Jonathan Taylor. I finished my Bsc/Msc (Licenciatura) in Physics and Mathematics in the University of Buenos Aires 🇦🇷.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    - 🧊 [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl): Global glacier model using Universal Differential Equations for climate-glacier interactions. Integrating the Julia differential programming tools with the [Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM)](https://oggm.org/) in Python.
    - 🌎 [PolarWandering](https://github.com/PolarWandering): Statistical modelling of Paleomagnetic data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about sensitivity methods for differential equations. Interested in participating? Check out our [review paper](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/review-diffeq-gradient)!
- 👨‍🏫 I am interested in teaching machine learning for geophysisc and good practices fordeveloping  open, reproducible and collaborative scientific software. 
    - [Collaborative and Reproducible Data Science at UC Berkeley](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/): Course given to undergraduate and graduate students.
    - [Machine Learning in Glaciology Workshop](https://machine-learning-in-glaciology-workshop.github.io): Given in Finse, Norway, to students and researchers working in the intersection of cryospheric sciences 🧊 and machine learning 🤖. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in the intersection between machine learning, geophysics and scientific computing.
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to send me an email to `fsapienza@berkeley@edu`.
